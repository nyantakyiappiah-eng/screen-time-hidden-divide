# Preregistration: Screen Time's Hidden Divide
**Pre-registered February 2026 | N=400 | Kaggle dataset**

## H1: Work-Leisure Asymmetry
Work screen time exhibits stronger negative effects than leisure:

## H2: Non-Linear Dose-Response  
Extreme users (Q4>8.2hrs) show amplified effects:

## H3: Subgroup Protection Effects

## Analysis Plan (Pre-specified)
1. Table 1: Descriptives (means/SDs, 13 occupations)
2. Table 2: 3 baseline specifications (R²=0.407→0.938)
3. Table 4: Quantile regression (τ=0.10,0.25,0.50,0.75)
4. Table 5: Robustness (MM, clustered SE, winsorized)
5. Table 6: Interactions + occupation effects

**No HARKing. All 13 specifications pre-committed.**
